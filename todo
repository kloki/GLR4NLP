Algorithm 

until todostate is empty
      
      if start:
      	 popfirst leftmost chain
      	 -Add state for all non terminals from gotos,state name are non terminals add state
	 -add shift state from terminal state name is terminal
      if rightsybling = $ and state  = "S" 
         add acc to $
      
      if rightsybling = $ 
               apply reduce too parent from lookahead terminal. new state is current state with reduce aplied thus v det n will turn in to v VP

      if rightsybling = terminal
              shift to new state, state is current state + terminals
      if right sybling = nonterminal:
          popleftmost chain
	  ass start
